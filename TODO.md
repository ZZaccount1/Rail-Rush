# Soon
- [ ] Make the player to be behind the top 2 tiles of the tree (just make a new layer in the tiled and name it "above the player", and instead of drawing the full tree in the entity layer, draw only the trunk tile)

# After the release
- [ ] Change in the map.tmx file name of the rocks from "stone" to "rocks"
