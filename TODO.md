# Soon
- [ ] Little tutorial(introduction about how to play the game. at the beggining the will be an arrow showing on the rock and on the tree and after chopping them there will appear an arrow above the empty rail tile)

# DONE
- [x] Make the player to be behind the top 2 tiles of the tree (just make a new layer in the tiled and name it "above the player", and instead of drawing the full tree in the entity layer, draw only the trunk tile)

# Additional stuff(if i will have enough time)
- [ ] Sprint/fatigue

# After the release
- [ ] Change in the map.tmx file name of the rocks from "stone" to "rocks"
